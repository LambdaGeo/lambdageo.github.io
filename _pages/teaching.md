### ⚙️ Compilers

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Languages/Tools**: Java, Haskell, Python, nand2tetris framework
- **Focus**: Lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, and optimization through hands-on compiler construction
- **Open Resources**: [GitHub Repo](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link) • [Sample Project: Build a Simple Interpreter](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link)
- **Why it matters internationally**: Develops transferable skills in formal languages, automata theory, and tooling — foundational for PL research, verification, and compiler engineering roles.

### 🧮 Algorithms & Data Structures

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C
- **Focus**: Algorithm design patterns, complexity analysis, and efficient data organization for geospatial and environmental datasets
- **Project Example**: Implement spatial indexing structures (R-trees, quadtrees) for land-use data queries
- **Global relevance**: Core competency for technical interviews and research in computational geography, optimization, and large-scale data processing.

### 🔄 Programming Paradigms

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Paradigms Covered**: Imperative, Object-Oriented, Functional (Haskell), Logic
- **Focus**: Comparative analysis of paradigms; when and why to choose each approach for scientific computing problems
- **Open Resource**: [Functional Programming Exercises in Haskell](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link)
- **International value**: Prepares students for diverse codebases and research environments that mix paradigms (e.g., data engineering pipelines).

### λ Functional Programming

- **Level**: Undergraduate elective / Graduate module
- **Language**: Haskell
- **Focus**: Pure functions, type systems, monads, and declarative problem-solving for reproducible scientific workflows
- **Connection to research**: Functional approaches support verifiable, side-effect-free geospatial data transformations
- **GitHub**: [Functional Geo-Exercises](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link)

### 🗺️ Introduction to Geoprocessing *(Graduate)*

- **Program**: Professional Master's in Environmental Science & Technology (PPGCTAmb)
- **Tools**: QGIS/PyQGIS, PostGIS, TerraLib, OGC standards
- **Focus**: Spatial data models, coordinate systems, geoprocessing workflows, and environmental modeling fundamentals
- **INPE Connection**: Builds on methodologies developed during my PhD research in dynamic land-use/land-cover modeling at INPE
- **Output**: Students produce reproducible geoprocessing pipelines for regional environmental analysis
- **Resources**: [Sample Dataset + Tutorial](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link) • [OGC Standards Quick Reference](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/link)

### 💻 Introduction to Computers *(Graduate)*

- **Program**: Professional Master's (PPGCTAmb / PROFCOMP)
