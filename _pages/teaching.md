### 🛰️ Google Earth Engine (GEE) Resources

I have developed specialized materials for using cloud computing in Remote Sensing. *Note: These resources are currently available in Portuguese (PT-BR).*

* **[Introduction to Satellite Image Processing and Analysis with GEE](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/GEE-Introdu-o-ao-processamento-e-an-lise-de-imagens-de-sat-lites-com-Google-Earth-Engine-GEE-199e9c164cce439c8a46e8519303d4d2)** A comprehensive guide and talk covering the fundamentals of the GEE JavaScript API, focusing on image collections, reducers, and environmental analysis workflows.

* **[GEE in Remote Sensing and Geoprocessing Education](https://www.notion.so/profsergiocosta/Google-Earth-Engine-no-Ensino-de-Introdu-o-ao-Sensoriamento-Remoto-e-ao-Geoprocessamento-5120512373a3485ab1d2d22cb44ea7a7)** Educational material designed to integrate cloud-based workflows into undergraduate introductory courses, replacing traditional local processing with planetary-scale data analysis.

### Summary

> The sections below provide English summaries of the core courses I regularly teach at UFMA, highlighting their technical focus and international relevance.

### ⚙️ Compilers

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Languages/Tools**: Java, Haskell, Python, nand2tetris framework
- **Focus**: Lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, and optimization through hands-on compiler construction
- **Why it matters internationally**: Develops transferable skills in formal languages, automata theory, and tooling — foundational for PL research, verification, and compiler engineering roles.

### 🧮 Algorithms & Data Structures

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C
- **Focus**: Algorithm design patterns, complexity analysis, and efficient data organization for geospatial and environmental datasets
- **Project Example**: Implement spatial indexing structures (R-trees, quadtrees) for land-use data queries
- **Global relevance**: Core competency for technical interviews and research in computational geography, optimization, and large-scale data processing.

### 🔄 Programming Paradigms

- **Level**: Undergraduate (Computer Engineering)
- **Paradigms Covered**: Imperative, Object-Oriented, Functional (Haskell), Logic
- **Focus**: Comparative analysis of paradigms; when and why to choose each approach for scientific computing problems
- **International value**: Prepares students for diverse codebases and research environments that mix paradigms (e.g., data engineering pipelines).

### λ Functional Programming

- **Level**: Undergraduate elective / Graduate module
- **Language**: Haskell
- **Focus**: Pure functions, type systems, monads, and declarative problem-solving for reproducible scientific workflows
- **Connection to research**: Functional approaches support verifiable, side-effect-free geospatial data transformations

### 🗺️ Introduction to Geoprocessing *(Graduate)*

- **Program**: Professional Master's in Environmental Science & Technology (PPGCTAmb)
- **Tools**: QGIS/PyQGIS, PostGIS, TerraLib, OGC standards
- **Focus**: Spatial data models, coordinate systems, geoprocessing workflows, and environmental modeling fundamentals
- **INPE Connection**: Builds on methodologies developed during my PhD research in dynamic land-use/land-cover modeling at INPE
- **Output**: Students produce reproducible geoprocessing pipelines for regional environmental analysis

### 💻 Introduction to Computers *(Graduate)*

- **Program**: Professional Master's (PPGCTAmb / PROFCOMP)
- **Focus**: Information representation, computer architecture fundamentals, operating system concepts for scientific workflows
