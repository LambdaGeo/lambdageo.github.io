# 🛰️ LambdaGEO — Computing and Geotechnology Research Group

Welcome to the official repository of **LambdaGEO**, a research group dedicated to developing innovative solutions in **Geoinformation**, **Geotechnologies**, **Spatial Modeling**, **Applied Computing**, and **Linked Data**. Our mission is to produce scientific knowledge and open-source technologies with significant social and academic impact.

Based at the **Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA)**, the group is affiliated with the **Graduate Program in Environmental Science & Technology (PPGC&TAmb)**.

## 👨‍🏫 Leadership
**Professor Sergio Souza Costa** is an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering at UFMA. With a PhD in Applied Computing from the **National Institute for Space Research (INPE)**, his work focuses on Geoinformation, Environmental Data, Web Systems, and LUCC (Land Use and Cover Change) Modeling.

> **Note to students:** I use **Notion** for detailed lecture materials and mentorship guidelines. You can access my workspace here: [profsergiocosta.notion.site](https://profsergiocosta.notion.site)

## 🔬 Research Interests
Our team conducts theoretical and practical research across several domains:
* **Geoprocessing & GIS** (Geographic Information Systems)
* **Geographic Data Science**
* **Environmental Modeling**
* **Software Engineering**
* **Linked Open Data** (Semantic Web)

---

## 📦 Key Projects & Software
We actively develop tools to bridge the gap between environmental data and web technologies:

* **DBAcademic:** Connecting public open data from educational institutions.
* **DBCells:** An architecture for publishing modeling data as Linked Data.
* **QGISSPARQL:** Tools for integrating Triple stores with QGIS (Triple2Layer & Layer2Triple).
* **SiMPoT:** Simple Object-triple Mapping for easier data integration.
